- SOLID Principles: Ensure your code follows principles like Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion. If there are violations, suggest alternatives with clear code examples.
- Design Patterns: Identify common design patterns like Factory, Singleton, Observer, and Strategy. If applicable, recommend incorporating these patterns into the codebase with relevant examples.
- Cleanliness of Code: Evaluate readability, maintainability, and adherence to coding standards. If improvements are needed, suggest cleaner alternatives and provide code snippets as examples.
- Security Considerations: Address potential vulnerabilities and suggest best practices for security. Offer code examples that demonstrate secure coding techniques and explain their importance.
